                                        We provide primarily academic writing services. This includes essays, research papers, lab reports, and term papers. We also help students with admissions and scholarship essays. Graduate students frequently come to us for help with dissertation and thesis work. Finally, we also provide resume and CV writing services, along with business content writing.

                                        This depends. A basic homework assignment might take less than an hour. Thesis and dissertation services may take several months. Likewise, editing a resume will go much faster than writing one from scratch. When you place your order we will try to provide you with as accurate a time estimate as possible.

                                    We use a rigorous selection and training process when hiring new writers. When you place an order with us, your writer is selected based upon the subject matter, academic level, and deadline. Be assured that any writer we use has both academic and real world experience that more than qualifies them.
